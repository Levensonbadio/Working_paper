	abstract = {Choice experiments have been extensively used in many stated preference studies and disciplines. In order to give external validity to stated preferences, participants must behave the same in an experiment setting as they do in reality. The difference between a decision made in a real experiment and a hypothetical experiment is commonly attributed to “hypothetical bias.” In this paper, we investigate whether virtual reality can reduce hypothetical bias in choice experiments. We conducted a set of experiments using the Food and Drug Administration's new Nutrition Facts Label for yogurts. Participants were randomly assigned to non‐hypothetical and hypothetical experiments, which differed in terms of visual presentations of the product in question: text, picture, and a virtual grocery store. Given the absence of real markets for the new label at the time of the research, we approximate the real market with a binding choice in our non‐hypothetical experiments. Our results suggest that although the hypothetical bias with virtual reality is not statistically significantly different from those using text or picture, it is the smallest. Among participants who did not exhibit high simulator discomfort, results suggest that virtual reality can significantly reduce hypothetical bias in choice experiments.},

Using data from an online survey of 804 Canadian adults, a discrete choice experiment elicits preferences for diverse novel food attributes and technologies, with respondents randomly assigned to different information conditions. We construct a logical‐scientific information condition, written in a scientific style using the passive voice with generalized and impersonal language and attributed to either a government agency or a scientific organization. In contrast, we frame the narrative‐style information condition as a story, using a lively and vivid personal style, and attributed to either a science journalist or a consumer blogger. Data are analyzed using multinomial logit and random parameters logit models. We find that the information format (logical‐scientific vs. narrative) matters: narratives help reduce negative perceptions regarding agricultural and food technologies. We also examine factors that predispose consumers to seek logical‐scientific versus narrative information sources.},

Experiment 2 found that a framing effect that occurred when presented in a decision format did not occur when the same situation was presented as a narrative.

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of regulatory focus on Chinese consumers’ intention to consume ethnic food, the mediating role of food neophobia and the moderating role of message framing with regard to regulatory focus and ethnic food consumption.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Lab experiments method was used in this paper, two studies were designed to test the relationship between regulatory focus, food neophobia, message framing and intention to eat ethnic food. Study 1 was to test the influence of regulatory focus on intention to eat ethnic food, and the mediation role of food neophobia. Study 2 was to test the moderation role of message framing.
            
            
              Findings
              Results indicated that consumers with promotion focus have higher intention to eat ethnic food than consumers with prevention focus. Prevention-focus consumers have higher food neophobia, which leads to lower intention to eat ethnic food. Food neophobia plays the mediating role in the relationship between regulatory focus and intention to eat ethnic food. Regulatory fit can increase consumers’ intention to eat ethnic food. Promotion-focus consumers show higher eating intention in gain-framing situation, while prevention-focus consumers show higher eating intention in loss-framing situation.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The study was undertaken in China. Further studies should include respondents living in countries other than China.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This research provides a venue for marketers of destination tourism, especially for ethnic food marketers to introduce and advertise ethnic foods to tourists. Regulatory fit is important for destination tourism. To improve consumers’ eating intention, this research suggests that ethnic food marketers should pay attention to regulatory focus of consumers from different regions and cultural background, and design corresponding message framing for consumers with different regulatory focus to form regulatory fit.
            
            
              Originality/value
              First, this study has proposed and tested regulatory focus’ effect on intention to consumer ethnic food. Food neophobia is used to explain the mechanism of relation between regulatory focus and intention to eat ethnic food. Also, message framing is introduced to define the boundary of relation between regulatory focus and intention to eat ethnic food.},

	abstract = {Genetically modified (GM) foods have attracted a great deal of controversy. While some consumers and organizations regard GM foods as safe, many other consumers and organizations remain concerned about their potential health risks. The results of three studies suggest that consumers respond differently to persuasive messages regarding GM foods on the basis of their preexisting attitudes. Weak anti-GM consumers tend to comply with a variety of pro-GM messages. In contrast, strong anti-GM consumers exhibit message-opposing behavior. Moreover, they respond just as negatively to a safety message (claiming that GM foods are safe) as to a risk message (claiming that GM foods are unsafe). The mechanism underlying these effects is consumers’ perceived health risk. A benefit message claiming that GM foods are beneficial (e.g., more nutritious than their conventional counterparts) is a better alternative for strong anti-GM consumers. Finally, the results suggest that persuasive messages do not significantly change pro-GM consumers’ evaluations of these foods.},

	abstract = {Integrating technology into agricultural systems has gained considerable traction, particularly over the last half century. Agricultural systems that incorporate the public’s concerns regarding farm animal welfare are more likely to be socially accepted in the long term, a key but often forgotten component of sustainability. Gene editing is a tool that has received considerable attention in the last five years, given its potential capacity to improve farm animal health, welfare, and production efficiency. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of Brazilian citizens regarding the applications of gene editing in cattle that generate offspring without horns; are more resistant to heat; and have increased muscle tissue. Using a mixed-methods approach, we surveyed participants via face-to-face, using in-depth interviews (Study 1) and an online questionnaire containing closed-ended questions (Study 2). Overall, the acceptability of gene editing was low and in cases where support was given it was highly dependent on the type and purpose of the application proposed. Using gene editing to improve muscle tissue growth was viewed as less acceptable compared to using gene editing to reduce heat stress or to produce hornless cattle. Support declined when the application was perceived to harm animal welfare, to be profit motivated or to reinforce the status quo of intensive livestock systems. The acceptability of gene editing was reduced when perceptions of risks and benefits were viewed as unevenly or unfairly distributed among consumers, corporations, different types of farmers, and the animals. Interviewees did not consider gene editing a “natural” process, citing dissenting reasons such as the high degree of human interference and the acceleration of natural processes. Our findings raised several issues that may need to be addressed for gene editing to comply with the social pillar of sustainable agriculture.},

            This article investigates the effectiveness of lottery incentive schemes for eliciting consumer valuations in large‐scale online experiments. We implement a fully incentivized condition within a geographically dispersed sample of consumers in which bids for a Criollo steak elicited by a Becker‐DeGroot‐Marschak mechanism are realized with certainty and the products are priority shipped in dry‐ice coolers. The fully incentivized condition is compared to between‐subject random incentivized schemes, in which only a fraction of subjects realize their choices. We tested two treatments with a 10\% probability framed as a percentage or an absolute number of subjects, one treatment with a 1\% probability, and a purely hypothetical reference condition. The results reveal that between‐subject random incentivized schemes with 10\% and 1\% payment probabilities are effective in eliciting valuations that are statistically indistinguishable from the fully incentivized scheme. In addition to finding insignificant statistical differences between 10\% and 1\% and the fully incentivized scheme, all incentivized conditions mitigate hypothetical bias, resulting in lower product valuations than the purely hypothetical condition. We contribute a novel methodological framework for conducting large‐scale experiments with geographically diverse and representative subjects, increasing the external validity and producing reliable valuations while significantly reducing financial and logistic constraints.},

	abstract = {A detailed account is given of the history, aetiology, biology, epidemiology, detection, geographical distribution, and control of huanglongbing (HLB), a destructive disease of citrus that represents a major threat to the world citrus industry, and is slowly invading new citrusgrowing areas. HLB, whose name in Chinese means "yellow dragon disease", was first reported from southern China in 1919 and is now known to occur in next to 40 different Asian, African, Oceanian, South and North American countries. The agent is a phloem-restricted, non cultured, Gram-negative bacterium causing crippling diseases denoted "greening" in South Africa, "mottle leaf" in the Philippines, "dieback" in India, "vein phloem degeneration" in Indonesia. The HLB bacterium belongs to the genus Candidatus Liberibacter, three species of which are currently known, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, occurring in Asian countries and, to a lesser extent, in Brazil and the USA (Florida), Candidatus Liberibacter africanus with its subspecies "capensis", recorded from African countries, and Candidatus Liberibacter americanus present in Brazil. The suggestion is that each liberibacter species has evolved in the continent after which it is named. HLB symptoms are virtually the same wherever the disease occurs. Infected trees show a blotchy mottle condition of the leaves that results in the development of yellow shoots, the early and very characteristic symptom of the disease. Trees are stunted, declining and bear a few, small-sized, and deformed (lop-sided) fruits, that are poorly coloured (greening) and with coloration starting at the peduncular end (colour inversion). HLB can be transmitted by grafting from citrus to citrus and by dodder to periwinkle. The psyllids Trioza erytreae and Diaphorina citri are natural vectors. Two different types of HLB are known: the heat-sensitive African form transmitted by T. erytreae, which develops at temperatures of 22-25°C, and the heat-tolerant Asian form, transmitted by D. citri, which stands temperatures well above 30°C. Although the HLB pathogen can be identified by electron microscopy, other laboratory methods are used for routine detection. ELISA with monoclonal antibodies is not recommended. Better systems are dot blot hybridization with a DNA probe, and various PCR formats (one-step, nested, multiplex) using species-specific primers based on 16S rRNA or rplKAJL-rpoBC operon sequences. Because no curative methods of HLB are available, control is preventive and largely based on inoculum elimination by removal of infected trees and chemical treatments against vectors. Strict quarantine measures must be implemented to impair further international spread of HLB agents and their vectors.},

	abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening is the most severe citrus disease, currently devastating the citrus industry worldwide. The presumed causal bacterial agent Candidatus Liberibacter spp. affects tree health as well as fruit development, ripening and quality of citrus fruits and juice. Fruit from infected orange trees can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic oranges are small, asymmetrical and greener than healthy fruit. Furthermore, symptomatic oranges show higher titratable acidity and lower soluble solids, solids/acids ratio, total sugars, and malic acid levels. Among ﬂavor volatiles, ethyl butanoate, valencene, decanal and other ethyl esters are lower, but many monoterpenes are higher in symptomatic fruit compared to healthy and asymptomatic fruit. The disease also causes an increase in secondary metabolites in the orange peel and pulp, including hydroxycinnamic acids, limonin, nomilin, narirutin, and hesperidin. Resulting from these chemical changes, juice made from symptomatic fruit is described as distinctly bitter, sour, salty/umami, metallic, musty, and lacking in sweetness and fruity/orange ﬂavor. Those effects are reported in both Valencia and Hamlin oranges, two cultivars that are commercially processed for juice in Florida. The changes in the juice are reﬂective of a decrease in quality of the fresh fruit, although not all fresh fruit varieties have been tested. Earlier research showed that HLB-induced off-ﬂavor was not detectable in juice made with up to 25\% symptomatic fruit in healthy juice, by chemical or sensory analysis. However, a blend with a higher proportion of symptomatic juice would present a detectable and recognizable off ﬂavor. In some production regions, such as Florida in the United States, it is increasingly difﬁcult to ﬁnd fruit not showing HLB symptoms. This review analyzes and discusses the effects of HLB on orange juice quality in order to help the citrus industry manage the quality of orange juice, and guide future research needs.},

	abstract = {Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating bacterial disease associated with ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’. The location of the pathogen within the vasculature of the tree has left growers with limited options for the effective management of the disease. Trunk injection is a crop protection technique that applies therapeutics directly into the xylem of woody tree species and allows for their systemic uptake and transport, which may provide more effective management of vascular diseases such as HLB. In this study, mature ‘Valencia’ and ‘Hamlin’ sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and ‘Duncan’ grapefruit (C. paradisi) trees were injected with oxytetracycline (OTC) in the spring and/or fall to evaluate the effects of injection timing and response to injection. In addition to seasonal evaluations of tree health and bacterial titer, preharvest fruit drop, yield, and fruit quality were measured at harvest to determine the effects of OTC injection. The beneﬁts associated with injection included a reduction in fruit drop, an increase in fruit yield and fruit size, and improvements in juice quality. However, results varied due to the timing of injection and were not consistent across all three varieties. Residue analysis at different time points after injection suggests that trunk injection effectively delivers therapeutics to mature citrus trees. This study provides fundamental information on the short-term beneﬁts associated with trunk injection of OTC for HLB management in citrus groves. The potential for use of trunk injection at the commercial scale and the possible risks are discussed.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial is an indispensable part of veterinary medicine used for the treatment and control of diseases as well as a growth promoter in livestock production. Frequent use of antimicrobials in veterinary practices may lead to the residue in animal originated products and creates some potential problems for human health. The presence of antimicrobial residues in animal originated foods may induce serious health problems such as allergic reaction, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and lead to carcinogenic and mutagenic effects in the human body. The misuse or abuse of antibiotics in human medicine is thought to be a principal cause of AMR but some antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and their resistant genes originating from animals are also responsible for developing AMR. However, the residual effect of antimicrobials in feed and food products of animal origin is undeniable. In developing countries, the community is unaware of this residual effect due to lack of proper information about antibiotic usage, AMR surveillance, and residue monitoring system. It is imperative to reveal the current situation of antimicrobial use in livestock production and its impacts on public health. Moreover, the safety levels of animal feeds and food products of animal origin must be strictly monitored and public awareness should be developed against the indiscriminate use of antimicrobial in animal production. Therefore, the current review summarizes the literature on antimicrobial use in livestock production and its hazardous residual impacts on the human body in developing countries.},

Las-infected ‘Hamlin’ sweet orange trees on ‘Swingle’ citrumelo rootstock at the early stage of decline were treated with oxytetracycline hydrochloride (OTC) using trunk injection with varying number of injection ports. Spatiotemporal distribution of OTC and dynamics of Las populations were monitored by high-performance liquid chromatography method and qPCR assay, respectively. Uniform distribution of OTC throughout tree canopies and root system was achieved 2 days postinjection. High levels of OTC ({\textgreater}850 µg/kg) were maintained in leaf and root for at least 1 month and moderate OTC ({\textgreater}500 µg/kg) persisted for more than 9 months. Reduction of Las populations in root system and leaves of OTC-treated trees were over 95\% and 99\% (i.e., 1.76 and 2.19 log reduction) between 2 and 28 days postinjection. Conditions of trees receiving OTC treatment were improved, fruit yield was increased, and juice acidity was lowered than water-injected control even though their differences were not statistically significant during the test period. Our study demonstrated that trunk injection of OTC could be used as an effective measure for integrated management of citrus HLB.},

Plant defense activators environmentally friendly compounds capable of inducing resistance against many plant pathogens. Earlier studies showed that foliar spray of plant defense inducers could slow down HLB disease progress. In this study, eight plant defense activators and three antibiotics were evaluated in three field trials for their effect to control HLB by trunk injection of young and mature sweet orange trees. Results showed that four trunk injections of several activators, including salicylic acid, oxalic acid, acibenzolar-S-methyl, and potassium phosphate, provided significant control of HLB by suppressing ‘Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus’ titer and disease progress. Trunk injection of penicillin, streptomycin, and oxytetracycline hydrochloride resulted in excellent control of HLB. In general, antibiotics were more effective in reduction of ‘Ca. L. asiaticus’ titer and HLB symptom expressions than plant defense activators. These treatments also resulted in increased yield and better fruit quality. Injection of both salicylic acid and acibenzolar-S-methyl led to significant induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes PR-1 and PR-2 genes. Meanwhile, injection of either potassium phosphate or oxalic acid resulted in significant induction of PR-2 or PR-15 gene expression, respectively. These results suggested that HLB diseased trees remained inducible for systemic acquired resistance under field conditions. In summary, this study presents information regarding controlling HLB via trunk injection of plant defense activators and antibiotics, which helps citrus growers in decision making regarding developing an effective HLB management program.},

            Compared with the EU, regulations on antibiotic use in livestock are less stringent in the USA. If consumers prefer non-antibiotic or minimal antibiotic-use meat, labeling different levels of antibiotic use in the USA could have the potential to mitigate the development of antibiotic-resistant livestock. This study used a survey of 660 US consumers to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for pork chops from pigs raised with different levels of antibiotic use. Results show that WTP for antibiotic-free pork chops is higher compared with WTP for pork chops produced with minimal use of antibiotics for disease treatment and conventional use of antibiotics for growth promotion. These findings suggest that it could be beneficial to differentiate usage levels of antibiotics when labeling pork products rather than stating ‘use’ or ‘no use’.},

              We conduct laboratory experiments for the multi-unit Vickrey auction
              with
              and
              without
              advice to subjects on strategy-proofness. The rate of truth-telling among the subjects without advice stays at 20\%, whereas the rate increases to 47\% among those who have received advice. By conducting similar experiments for the pay-your-bid auction, which is not strategy-proof, we confirm that the increase in truth-telling is due significantly to the
              net advice effect
              (i.e., the effect beyond the so-called experimenter demand effect). Moreover, we find that providing advice improves efficiency in the Vickrey auction, particularly in the early periods, when the subjects are less experienced. In general, subjects tend to overbid in Vickrey auction experiments. Our results indicate the possibility that providing simple advice decreases such overbidding by promoting a better understanding of the strategy-proofness of the Vickrey auction. Strategy-proof mechanisms are sometimes criticized because players often fail to recognize the benefit of telling the truth. However, our observations show that introducing advice on the property of strategy-proofness helps them behave “correctly.”},

              The purpose of this paper is to explore consumers’ intention to purchase genetically modified (GM) food from the perspective of risk information.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              A conceptual model was proposed in which intention to purchase GM food is stimulated by the combination and complex effects of knowledge, risk perception, information need, information seeking and attitude. A face-to-face questionnaire survey was conducted in Jinan, Shandong Province. A total of 757 valid samples (55.6 percent of women vs men) were involved to conduct structural equation model analysis.
            
            
              Findings
              Results demonstrated that attitude is the most important predictor of intention to purchase GM food. Attitude, in turn, is predicted by risk perception and information seeking. Risk perception is a significant determinant of information need and information seeking. Moreover, information need influences information seeking. Finally, knowledge plays a critical role in risk perception and intention. Overall, the explained variance of the model is 66 percent.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The study provides new insights explaining intention to purchase GM food by constructing a conceptual model from the perspective of risk information. In this model, knowledge, risk perception, information need and information seeking are all based on information related to GM food, resulting in attitude and intention to purchase.},

            This article documents the economic relevance of measuring cognitive uncertainty: people’s subjective uncertainty over their ex ante utility-maximizing decision. In a series of experiments on choice under risk, the formation of beliefs, and forecasts of economic variables, we show that cognitive uncertainty predicts various systematic biases in economic decisions. When people are cognitively uncertain—either endogenously or because the problem is designed to be complex—their decisions are heavily attenuated functions of objective probabilities, which gives rise to average behavior that is regressive to an intermediate option. This insight ties together a wide range of empirical regularities in behavioral economics that are typically viewed as distinct phenomena or even as reflecting preferences, including the probability weighting function in choice under risk; base rate insensitivity, conservatism, and sample size effects in belief updating; and predictable overoptimism and -pessimism in forecasts of economic variables. Our results offer a blueprint for how a simple measurement of cognitive uncertainty generates novel insights about what people find complex and how they respond to it.},

              This study used a national survey to examine how information that compared and contrasted gene editing with other breeding techniques, as well as a narrative, influenced both attitudes towards gene editing generally and preferences between a gene‐edited insect and gene‐edited tree to combat citrus greening. Consumers had low familiarity with gene editing but linked it to genetic modification. For citrus greening, respondents equally supported a gene‐edited insect or tree, but the narrative decreased the perceived safety of both. These findings suggest that in general, consumers may support gene editing approaches to combat citrus greening.

              Background
              This study statistically explores the relationship between information provision and peoples’ attitudes towards the application of gene-editing technology to food, by contrasting cases of gene-edited livestock and vegetables in Japan. Japanese food producers and researchers are optimistic about the application of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) approach to food. Due to the strict regulations regarding genetically modified (GM) food, GM crops are not commercially cultivated in Japan. Consumers worldwide have concerns about application of this technology to food. Further examination of this issue for Japanese consumers with lower acceptance towards GM food should provide essential information for global agricultural communities.
            
            
              Methods
              Using a web survey, split-ballot experimental design was used to randomly assign the respondents into two groups: (1) the animal group, for which information on breeding technologies, including gene editing, was provided using pig illustrations. (2) The plant group, for which information was provided using tomato illustrations. Multivariate analysis of variance and post-hoc t-tests were applied to examine the statistical differences between the plant and animal groups for attitudes towards gene-edited livestock and vegetables. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine if scientific knowledge influences these attitudes.
            
            
              Results
              Respondents found gene-edited vegetables more beneficial than gene-edited livestock. Their agreement was stronger for vegetables than for livestock. Respondents’ attitudes towards gene-edited livestock differed depending on whether they were shown pig illustrations or tomato illustrations. The plant group scored significantly lower regarding gene-edited livestock compared to the animal group. No statistical difference was observed between the two groups in the case of gene-edited vegetables. Furthermore, the higher science literacy group always scored higher regarding improvements in vegetable breeding, but this was not concordant regarding improvements in livestock breeding.
            
            
              Conclusions
              People were more concerned about gene-edited livestock than gene-edited vegetables. The respondents who were provided information with tomato illustrations in advance demonstrated lower acceptance towards gene-edited livestock than those who were provided information with pig illustrations. Applying the technology to livestock, such as size enlargement for improvements, might be considered as risky by the public, in contrast with vegetables.},

            The increasing number of university students participating in international mobility programs worldwide calls for a better understanding of the effects of studying abroad. Despite the frequent claim that these programs enhance participants’ labor market prospects, there is no clear consensus in the literature about their impact on earnings. The present article attempts to shed light on this issue by applying meta‐analysis techniques to 166 estimates of returns to studying abroad from 17 studies. Summary measures used in meta‐analysis indicate that participation in study abroad programs during university studies has a small positive effect on post‐graduation earnings. However, due to the high heterogeneity and publication bias, this conclusion should be interpreted very cautiously. Multivariate meta‐regression analysis shows that the omission of relevant variables from the wage equation, the econometric methods employed, and the duration of the study abroad experience contribute to explain variation in the empirical findings.},

	abstract = {The wild bootstrap was originally developed for regression models with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. Over the past 30 years, it has been extended to models estimated by instrumental variables and maximum likelihood and to ones where the error terms are (perhaps multiway) clustered. Like bootstrap methods in general, the wild bootstrap is especially useful when conventional inference methods are unreliable because large-sample assumptions do not hold. For example, there may be few clusters, few treated clusters, or weak instruments. The package boottest can perform a wide variety of wild bootstrap tests, often at remarkable speed. It can also invert these tests to construct confidence sets. As a postestimation command, boottest works after linear estimation commands, including regress, cnsreg, ivregress, ivreg2, areg, and reghdfe, as well as many estimation commands based on maximum likelihood. Although it is designed to perform the wild cluster bootstrap, boottest can also perform the ordinary (nonclustered) version. Wrappers offer classical Wald, score/Lagrange multiplier, and Anderson–Rubin tests, optionally with (multiway) clustering. We review the main ideas of the wild cluster bootstrap, offer tips for use, explain why it is particularly amenable to computational optimization, state the syntax of boottest, artest, scoretest, and waldtest, and present several empirical examples.},

            This study investigates consumer preferences for newly introduced gene‐edited (GE) food. We focus on how risk and ambiguity aversion affect consumers’ willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid genetically modified (GM) food or GE food and whether the impacts of risk and ambiguity aversion differ between GM and GE food. We collected the data in 2020 through a nationwide online survey in China. The multiple price list method is used to estimate the premiums that consumers are willing to pay for conventional rice to avoid GM/GE rice. Our results show that Chinese urban consumers are more concerned about the health, environmental, and ethical impacts of genetic modification than gene editing technology. They are willing to pay lower premiums when the alternative is GE rice than when it is GM rice. We further find that both risk aversion and ambiguity aversion have significant negative impacts on respondents’ WTP for food derived from gene technologies, with ambiguity aversion being more influential than risk aversion for both GM and GE rice. However, there is no significant difference in how risk aversion and ambiguity aversion affect the respondents’ WTP to avoid GM or GE rice.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              This study analyzes the causal effect of education on consumers' cognition and attitudes toward genetically modified (GM) foods.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors propose an analytical framework to clarify the role of education levels and education content in the formation of attitudes toward GM foods and utilize education reforms in China as natural experiments to test the theoretical predictions empirically. For education levels, the authors use Compulsory Education Law's implementation to construct the instrument variable. For education content, the authors utilize the revision of the biology textbook in the Eighth Curriculum Reform to implement staggered difference-in-difference estimation. The authors use two national household surveys, the China Genuine Progress indicator Survey (CGPiS) and the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) of 2017, combined with provincial-level data of education reforms.
            
            
              Findings
              The education level, instrumented by the Compulsory Education Law's implementation, has an insignificant effect on consumers' cognition and attitudes toward GM foods, whereas the acquisition of formal education on genetic science, introduced by the Eighth Curriculum Reform, has a statistically significant and positive influence.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This is the first study to investigate the causal effects of education level and content on consumers' cognition and attitude toward GM foods using national representative data. It is also the first to evaluate the long-term effects of the biology textbook reform in China. The findings help open the black box of how education shapes people's preferences and attitudes and highlight the significance of formal biology education in formulating consumers' willingness to accept GM foods.},

            Gene‐editing is a breakthrough technology for crop improvement that addresses many concerns associated with its predecessor and distinctly different technology, genetically modified crops. The commercial success of gene‐editing technology depends on the public's acceptance of its foods. This study used data from a national survey of United States consumers to identify the determinants of consumer acceptance of gene‐edited foods and compared them with those of genetically modified foods. Our study shows that consumer awareness and knowledge of gene‐edited foods are almost half those of genetically modified foods. In the study, we classified survey respondents in three clusters based on their attitudes toward food technologies and corporate distrust: technology‐loving, neutral, and technology‐averse. The technology‐averse cluster has the greatest share of individuals who indicated being aware of and knowledgeable about gene‐edited foods, and the largest share of respondents who stated having negative views toward agricultural biotechnology. Technology‐loving individuals have more positive perceptions about agricultural biotechnology and are more likely to consume genetically modified and gene‐edited foods in the future than neutral and technology‐averse individuals. Findings indicate that providing information on the technology and its health and environmental benefits did not affect consumers' willingness to consume genetically modified and gene‐edited foods. Prior perceptions of agricultural biotechnology, beliefs about safety, benefits, labeling, and the type of technology developer are important determinants of anticipated future consumption of genetically modified and gene‐edited foods. [EconLit Citations: Q13, Q16].},

This study asks whether a person’s knowledge of biology affects their assessment of these factors differently. A random sample of the Danish population ( n = 2000) was presented with questionnaires. The respondent’s knowledge was measured by a number of textbook questions on biology. The results indicated that knowledge increases the likelihood that a person will have differentiated opinions on medical and agricultural applications, but decreases the likelihood that he or she will differentiate between cisgenic and transgenic cereals. We discuss the implication that knowledge makes people more likely to base their acceptance on judgements of risks and benefits, rather than on judgements of naturalness. The article concludes that the effect of knowledge on acceptance cannot be generalised wholesale from one application, or method, to others.},

	abstract = {Background
              Smartphone apps may provide an opportunity to deliver mental health resources and interventions in a scalable and cost-effective manner. However, young people from marginalized and underserved groups face numerous and unique challenges to accessing, engaging with, and benefiting from these apps.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aims to better understand the acceptability (ie, perceived usefulness and satisfaction with an app) and feasibility (ie, the extent to which an app was successfully used) of mental health apps for underserved young people. A secondary aim was to establish whether adaptations can be made to increase the accessibility and inclusivity of apps for these groups.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted 2 sequential studies, consisting of a systematic literature review of mental health apps for underserved populations followed by a qualitative study with underserved young male participants (n=20; age: mean 19). Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, an electronic search of 5 databases was conducted in 2021. The search yielded 18,687 results, of which 14 articles met the eligibility criteria.
            
            
              Results
              The included studies comprised a range of groups, including those affected by homelessness, having physical health conditions, living in low- and middle-income countries, and those with sexual and gender minority identities. Establishing and maintaining user engagement was a pervasive challenge across mental health apps and populations, and dropout was a reported problem among nearly all the included studies. Positive subjective reports of usability, satisfaction, and acceptability were insufficient to determine users’ objective engagement.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Despite the significant amount of funding directed to the development of mental health apps, juxtaposed with only limited empirical evidence to support their effectiveness, few apps have been deliberately developed or adapted to meet the heterogeneous needs of marginalized and underserved young people. Before mental health apps are scaled up, a greater understanding is needed of the types of services that more at-risk young people and those in limited-resource settings prefer (eg, standard vs digital) followed by more rigorous and consistent demonstrations of acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Adopting an iterative participatory approach by involving young people in the development and evaluation process is an essential step in enhancing the adoption of any intervention, including apps, in “real-world” settings and will support future implementation and sustainability efforts to ensure that marginalized and underserved groups are reached.

The comparison is made along three dimensions: the noise in the data due to inattention, the cost per observation, and the elasticity of response. We draw samples from each population, examining decisions in four one-shot games with varying tensions between the individual and socially efficient choices. When there is no tension, where individual and pro-social incentives coincide, noisy behavior accounts for 60\% of the observations on MTurk, 19\% on Prolific, and 14\% for the lab. Taking costs into account, if noisy data is the only concern Prolific dominates from an inferential power point of view, combining relatively low noise with a cost per observation one fifth of the lab's. However, because the lab population is more sensitive to treatment, across our main PD game comparison the lab still outperforms both Prolific and MTurk.},

	abstract = {We implemented a cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of genetically modified eggplant (Bt brinjal) in Bangladesh. Our two primary outcomes were changes in yield and in pesticide costs. Cultivation of Bt brinjal raises yields by 3,564 kg/ha. This statistically significant impact is equivalent to a 51\% increase relative to the control group. There is a statistically significant fall in pesticide costs, 7,175 Taka per hectare (85 USD per ha), a 37.5\% reduction. Yield increases arise because Bt farmers harvest more eggplant and because fewer fruits are discarded because they are damaged. Bt brinjal farmers sell more eggplant and receive a higher price for the output they sell while incurring lower input costs, resulting in a 128\% increase in net revenues. Bt brinjal farmers used smaller quantities of pesticides and sprayed less frequently. Bt brinjal reduced the toxicity of pesticides as much as 76\%. Farmers growing Bt brinjal and who had pre‐existing chronic conditions consistent with pesticide poisoning were 11.5\% points less likely to report a symptom of pesticide poisoning and were less likely to incur cash medical expenses to treat these symptoms. Our results are robust to changes in model specification and adjustment for multiple hypothesis testing. We did not find evidence of heterogeneous effects by farmer age, schooling, or land cultivated. Bt brinjal is a publicly developed genetically modified organism that conveys significant productivity and income benefits while reducing the use of pesticides damaging to human and ecological health.},

            The absence of an incentive‐compatible mechanism to reveal consumers' true willingness to pay in stated preference elicitation methods and the consequent hypothetical bias are an important concern in discrete choice experiments. Our study extends this discourse on hypothetical bias by examining how it varies with the heterogeneity in respondents' cognitive ability and familiarity with a good. This paper also adds to our understanding of the demand for agricultural insurance in developing countries by studying the willingness to pay for one of the world's largest agricultural insurance programs using a large state representative sample. Following a between‐subject design, we implemented a large scale randomized incentivized choice experiment and hypothetical choice experiment with real farmers who make decisions on the purchase of insurance. We find that demand for an insurance product is shaped by the subject's familiarity with and cognitive ability to understand the product. We show that the magnitude of the hypothetical bias is higher at a lower level of cognitive ability and that bias diminishes with an increase in cognitive ability. Finally, we examine key heterogeneity and test a number of possible mechanisms.},

For this to occur, label claims have to be truthful, credible, and understandable. We examine the introduction of “Raised Without Antibiotics” (RWA) label claims in the broiler industry by Perdue Farms (Perdue) and Tyson Foods (Tyson) in 2007 and the events that follow. We ask whether voluntary label claims were able to improve efficiency in the market for RWA chicken products. In this case, evidence presented as part of court testimony suggests that Tyson did not deliver the RWA attribute that consumers demanded, competitors suffered, and Tyson profited from introducing what was ruled to be a false and misleading label claim to the marketplace. While the media informed consumers and stockholders of these events, we found little evidence in publicly available data, literature, or documentation from court cases that Tyson suffered significant harm in the market, or from stockholders. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service did ultimately remove Tyson's label claims from the marketplace, and the legal system provided some redress to competitors and consumers. Even so, labels with animal raising claims (such as RWA) and voluntary, process‐based label claims (in general) continue to be challenged by similar issues, that is, consumer confusion, the absence of universally accepted definitions, and varying degrees of credibility.},

We examine the relationship between willingness to pay a premium for products that avoid a controversial technology and willingness to vote in favor of a ban or mandatory labeling, with a focus on how this relationship is influenced by income and perceived risks. In a survey regarding genetically modified (GM) food, we find that the majority of respondents make consumer and voter choices that can be explained by a standard utility maximization framework. However, certain respondent characteristics are correlated with inconsistent choice patterns. In particular, low‐income voters appear to be overly supportive of regulation relative to their private willingness to pay. Voters who are uncertain about the safety of GM food also tend to be more in favor of regulation than their consumer choices would imply.},

	abstract = {Previous literature analyzing the effects of incentive compatibility of experimental payment mechanisms is dominated by theory. With overwhelming evidence of theory violations in a multiplicity of domains, we fill this gap by empirically exploring the effects of different payment mechanisms in induced preference elicitation using a large sample of over 3800 participants across three experiments. In Experiment 1, we collected responses for offer prices to sell a card like in Cason and Plott (2014), systematically varying on a between-subjects basis the way subjects received payments over repeated rounds, by either paying for all decisions (and various modifications) or just one, as well as making the payments certain, probabilistic or purely hypothetical. While we find that the magnitude of the induced value and the range of the prices used to draw a random price significantly affect misbidding behavior, neither the payment mechanism nor the certainty of payment affected misbidding. In Experiment 2, we replaced the BDM mechanism with a second price auction and found similar results, albeit less misbidding rates. In Experiment 3, we examine the effect of payment mechanisms on choice under risk and find portfolio effects (i.e., paying all rounds) when the lottery pairs do not involve options with certainty. Overall, our empirical exercise shows that payment mechanism design considerations should place more weight on the choice architecture rather than on incentive compatibility.},
